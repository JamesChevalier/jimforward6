# JIMFORWARD6

This is the source code for my write-in campaign's website. It's built with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), so that it works nicely on both desktops/laptops and mobile devices.

The photos and video were created by [Jeffrey Byrnes](http://jeffreybphotography.com).

You can use this code to see how a pretty standard flat HTML site works with Foundation. The only major customization is the background. There are two posts on Forrst that cover that code fairly well:

* [Are there better/kinder ways to get transparency in HTML than this 3-div method?](https://forrst.com/posts/Are_there_better_kinder_ways_to_get_transparency-JIg)
* [Better/kinder transparency in HTML](https://forrst.com/posts/Better_kinder_transparency_in_HTML-JIs)

I've also got other code up for transparent layers [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/JamesChevalier/1506869).
